# Siberia Front End Assessment

### **What's In Here**
In the `/audio` directory, you will find 3 files:
1. **test.wav** a spoken-word audio file
2. **test.json** a text transcript of test.wav in JSON format, as output by the Google Speech to Text API
3. **test.csv** same as above, but in CSV format  


### **The Brief**
- Using the files above, please create a simple web experience that will render the words found in one of the transcript files in time with the audio playback. 
- How the words and audio are rendered and any interaction or animation is entirely up to you. We have intentionally omitted any specific design documents from this exercise, so feel free to take your own creative liberties in service of a beautiful and elegant user experience.
- For the sake of this exercise, you are free to use any languages, frameworks or tools that you think will help you get the job done. Do not feel that you must pull from the standard Siberia toolbox (because such a thing doesn't really exist anyway).
- Please work in a feature branch of this repo.
- When you are finished, please submit your feature branch as a pull request against `master` and assign it for review.
- Feel free to add additional notes or instructions to this readme file.
- This should be a simple and fun way to give us a quick taste of what you can do. It shouldn't need to take up too much of your time, so please don't go too crazy with it.

  
### **What are we looking for?**
Your output should be polished and complete in a way that you would be comfortable handing over to a client as a (pre-QA) final deliverable. 
  
The point of this exercise is simply to see how you would work through a task. This helps us assess if, when and where you might be a good fit for the team. That can take a wide variety of forms, so please don't try to second guess what you think we might be looking for... we want to see how _you_ would approach a problem â€“ not how you think we would approach it.
